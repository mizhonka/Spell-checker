# Week 1 Report

**Hours used in total:** 3

## What I did

This week I simply decided and did research for my chosen topic (a spell checker). I read about Damerau–Levenshtein distance, the trie structure and Ispell and wrote my project specification
document.

## How has the project progressed?

At this point no process in programming has happened, I only have a concept of what I'm going to do and what kind of structures or algorithms I need.

## What I learned this week

Both the trie data structure and the Damerau–Levenshtein distance were new topics to me. I hadn't really thought before how spell checkers work and how simple in terms of the idea they can be.

## What has been unclear or problematic?

I'm still not sure how I'm going to get the needed vocabulary in my program in practice (what is my source?).  

I also haven't decided how many correction suggestions should be given for misspelled words. I'm guessing there can be lots of words that have a DL distance of one with the misspelled word.

## What next?

Next week I'm going to start working on core functionality (maybe have a small trie tree of words and implement search and calculation of DL distance).
