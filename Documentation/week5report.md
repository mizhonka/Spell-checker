# Week 5 Report

**Hours used:** 2

## What I did

Did some error checking and pylint improvements to index.  

Implemented trie structure to WordList and created a function for removing punctuation.  

## How has the project progressed?

The words are now stored in a trie. If the user input contains any punctuation or numbers, they are removed from the words in question.

## What I learned this week

I learned how a trie works and how it's implemented.

## What has been unclear or problematic?

My algorithm feels still slow and I'm not sure if I should be doing something else to optimize. Also I'm not sure how to iterate through the whole trie of words and if it's anymore effective than to just iterate a list.

## What next?

Main functionality is done, so next I'm mainly focusing on testing and documentation. If I have time I might work on the UI.
