## How has the project progresseprogramming has happened, I only have a concept of what I'm going to do and what kind of structures or algorithms I need.

## What I learned this week

Both the trie data structure and the Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance were new topics to me. I hadn't really thought before how spell checkers work and how simple in terms of the idea they can be.

## What has been unclear or problematic?

'm still not sure how I'm going to get the needed vocabulary in my program in practice (what is my source?).  

I also haveny cs should be given for misspelled words. I'm guessing there can be lots of words that have a DL distance of one with the misspelled word.

## What next?
