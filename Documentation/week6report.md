# Week 6 Report

**Hours used:** 4

## What I did

Changed my vocabulary list to a smaller one with more common words.

Implemented a depth-first search for the trie, so there's no need for storing a list for iteration.

Continued working on the implementation document.

## How has the project progressed?

Because of the new word list, the correction process is now faster and is more likely to suggest appropriate words.

## What I learned this week

Didn't learn, but reviewed how depth-first search works.

## What has been unclear or problematic?

I'm unsure what type of testing I should be doing (aside from unit tests).

## What next?

Doing necessary testing and finishing documentation, possibly UI improvements.
